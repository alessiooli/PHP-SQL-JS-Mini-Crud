# PHP-SQL-JS-Mini-Crud

The smallest interactive crud in the world, made in PHP, SQL, JS.

## Why?

This is a project I'm working on, a small crud to interact with a SQL database. Wasn't planned to go public, but I thought it could help somebody who's learning web development. If you need help, reach me out on my website.

## Tech Stack
